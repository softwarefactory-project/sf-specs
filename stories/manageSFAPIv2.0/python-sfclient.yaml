title: python-sfclient library
description: |
  # Objective

  Merge python-sfmanager and pysflib into one single project, that will provide
  a true python client library and the CLI.

  # Project structure

  ```
  python-sfclient/
    auth/           # from pysflib
    components/
        gerrit      # from pysflib
        storyboard  # from pysflib
        cauth       # new, to manage local users
        managesf    # from python-sfmanager & swagger autogenerated client
    cli/            # from python-sfmanager
  ```

  ## Components

  Components managers must support direct access to the component's API and using
  SF specificities, in particular one should be able to use a SF user id **or** a
  component's internal user id to perform relevant requests.
