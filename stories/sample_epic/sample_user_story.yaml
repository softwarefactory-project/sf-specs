title: Sample story that is part of a big epic
description: |
  This is where the story gets a nice description
  so that everybody clearly understands what is at
  stake. It should state who wants what, for example
  "as a user, I want to have chocolate chips cookies."
  It should also mention:
  
  * technical challenges
  * unknowns
  * impact on existing components
  * etc

  At least one task must follow; possibly at least one
  for writing documentation about the feature and one
  to test it (functional or integration tests).
  
  this can be formatted with markdown
  -----------------------------------

  which is pretty cool.
tasks:
  - title: a very important task

      this optional field will be a note on the task.
