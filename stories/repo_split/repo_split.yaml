title: Split repositories
description: |
  With the recent packaging of all SF component, the last manually installed piece
  is the sfconfig. To enable a better install process (disk-image-builder or on
  top of a regular centos), sfconfig needs to be packaged.

  To finish the transition here is the proposed repository split::

  * sf-docs for docs/
  * sf-config for config/
  * sf-release for upgrade/
  * release.softwarefactory-project.io (or github similar page) for the README
  * sf-ci for the rest
tasks:
  - title: Filter-branch sf-docs
    project: software-factory/software-factory
  - title: Filter-branch sf-config
    project: software-factory/software-factory
  - title: Filter-branch sf-release and modify ci script to consume external upgrade process
    project: software-factory/software-factory
  - title: Move README and CHANGELOG to a page repository
    project: software-factory/software-factory
