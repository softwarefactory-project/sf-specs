title: Firehose consumer
description: |
  # Objectives

  Consume the firehose flux to store data. This data will be used by managesf
  whenever services cannot provide enough information easily for its API (I'm
  looking at you, jenkins nodepool and zuul)

  Let's call the consuming service __hydrant__ to keep with firehose!

  # Storage

  Given that firehose produces JSON and that most queries will be text based,
  ElasticSearch is the easiest choice for the backend.

  # Prerequisites

  * Firehose must be a mandatory service
  * ElasticSearch must be a mandatory service

  # Implementation

  * The consumer should be a python service listening to all software-factory defined
  channels on firehose.
  * The data must be consistently timestamped: this is the case for messages emitted
  by zuul, nodepool and gerrit but a timestamp must be added to jenkins messages.
