title: Native multiple e-mails management
description: |
  As a Software Factory user, I want to be able to manage my e-mails
  through the manageSF API.

  Typical CRUD operations (except update, as it doesn't make much sense)
  should be supported.

  ```GET manage/services_users/<ID>/e-mails/
     [{"id": 1, "e-mail": "titi@toto", "primary": True}, {"id":2, "e-mail": "tata@tutu", "primary": False}, ...]```

  ```GET manage/services_users/<ID>/e-mails/1
     {"id": 1, "e-mail": "titi@toto", "primary": True}```

  ```POST manage/services_users/<ID>/e-mails/lololo@lululu
     HTTP 201 or HTTP 403 if e-mail is already claimed (by any user)```

  Following a new valid POST action, an e-mail is sent to the address with an activation link. The activation link
  is a template page that will request the following API call to validate the e-mail.

  ```GET manage/services_users/<ID>/e-mails/1/<random activation code>
     HTTP 201 + {"id": 1, "e-mail": "titi@toto", "primary": True} if client sets header "Accept: application/json",
     HTTP 400 if code + user id is incorrect```

  ```PUT manage/services_users/<ID>/e-mails/3
     {"id":3, "e-mail": "lololo@lululu", "primary": True}```

  ```DEL manage/services_users/<ID>/e-mails/1
     HTTP 204 OK or HTTP 403 Forbidden if e-mail is primary```
