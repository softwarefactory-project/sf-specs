title: Native SSH key management
description: |
  As a Software Factory user, I want to be able to manage my SSH keys
  through the manageSF API.

  Typical CRUD operations (except update, as it doesn't make much sense)
  should be supported.

  ```GET manage/services_users/<ID>/ssh_keys/
     [{"id": 1, "ssh-rsa ..."}, {"id":2, "ssh-rsa ..."}, ...]```

  ```GET manage/services_users/<ID>/ssh_keys/1
     {"id": 1, "ssh-rsa ..."}```

  ```POST manage/services_users/<ID>/ssh_keys/
     {"id":3, "ssh-rsa ..."}```

  ```DEL manage/services_users/<ID>/ssh_keys/1
     HTTP 204 OK```
